# Beincom Todo App

Beincom is a social platform for community builders to build and grow their communities. As part of your daily work routine, you often have numerous tasks to complete. To ensure you stay organized and don't miss anything, you've decided to create a todo app. Since you frequently use BIC Group and BIC Chat, two apps developed by the company, in your work, you aim to design the todo app's appearance to match the style of these existing company apps.

- **src**: This directory contains the main source code of the application, including JavaScript files and other assets such as images and fonts.
  - **assets**: Asset folder to store all images, vectors, fonts, etc.
  - **components**: Folder to store any common component that you use throughout your app (such as a generic button).
  - **constants**: Folder to store any kind of constant that you have.
  - **helpers**: Common API controllers.
  - **languages**: Folder to store languages used throughout your app.
  - **models**: Folder to store object types used throughout your app.
  - **navigation**: Folder to store the navigators.
  - **pages**: Contains different pages or screens of your app like HomeScreen, LoginScreen, etc.
  - **store**: This folder should have all your reducers and store.


## Installation

Step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the project. For example:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/ThinhNguyen2002/bic-todo-app.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd bic-todo-app
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

5. Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
